# JavaScript Loop Practice
This repository contains **10 beginner-friendly JavaScript problems** to practice different loop constructs such as `for`, `for-of`, `for-in`, `forEach`, `continue`, and `break`.

---

## Problems Covered

1. **Stationaries** (for loop) – Stop when `"Pencil"` is found and store items before it.  
2. **Drinks** (for loop) – Skip `"Milk"` and store all other drinks.  
3. **Numbers** (for-of loop) – Stop when number `4` is found and store smaller numbers.  
4. **Fruits** (for-of loop) – Skip `"Cherry"` and store the rest.  
5. **City Populations** (for-in loop) – Stop when `"Berlin"` is found and store earlier cities.  
6. **Large Cities** (for-in loop) – Skip cities with population `< 3,000,000`.  
7. **Breakfast Items** (forEach loop) – Check until `"Coffee"` is found and store all items before it.  
8. **Transport** (forEach loop) – Skip `"Train"` and store the rest.  
9. **Doubled Numbers** (for loop) – Skip `7` and double the remaining numbers.  
10. **Food Names** (for-of loop) – Stop when an item has more than 10 characters.
